Question: What is your preferable Git branching model and why?

Answer: I prefer the GitHub flow since it is very simple to use, easy to understand and implement, and it goes well with Agile development. In practice, it works well with continuous integration and continuous deployment tools to ensure that every change on the main branch has been tested and meets the quality standards. Additionally, because all changes start from the main branch, it also avoids confusion and incorrect merging between branches.
