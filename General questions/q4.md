Question: 
What are your preferred practices about deploying code to production ? Can you explain to us your methodology and give examples on how you would implement a production pipeline?


Answer: 
As a frontend developer, my preferred practices for deploying code to production would involve the following:

- **Use Continuous Integration(CI) tools.** Use a CI/CD tool like Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deployment process. This ensures that any code changes are tested and validated before deployment.

- **Use version control.** Use a version control system to manage code changes and enable rollbacks in case of issues.

- **Environment management.** Use different environments for development and production. This ensures that changes are tested in a controlled environment before deploying to production.

- **Have rollback plans.** Have a well-defined rollback plan in case of issues during deployment to production. This will ensure a quick recovery in case of any issues.

- **Security.** Ensure that all code changes follow security best practices and are compliant with applicable regulations.

An example of how I would implement a production pipeline for a front-end web application would involve the following steps:

- **Code Changes:** Developers commit their code changes to a version control system like GitHub.

- **Continuous Integration:** The CI/CD tool automatically builds and tests the code changes, creating a build artifact.

- **Staging Environment:** The build artifact is deployed to a staging environment where automated tests are run to ensure that the changes are functional and meet the desired quality standards.

- **Review and Approval:** The changes are reviewed and approved by the leader before deployment to production.

- **Production Deployment:** The changes are deployed to the production environment using a rolling deployment strategy.

- **Rollback:** In case of issues, a well-defined rollback plan is executed to quickly recover from any issues.
