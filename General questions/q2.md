Question: What is your approach to building an application that is talking to many different services? How would you set up an architecture that can support various integrations from different services (3rd party API, DBs, embedding of Sub Applications). Can you give us some best practices you would follow and give us an example of your ideas.

Answer: 
As a frontend developer, I would use following several practices to building an application that talks to multiple services:

- **Apply a modular approach.** Split the application into smaller, independent modules, with each module responsible for a specific functionality. This enables the application to communicate with the services through APIs, and each module can be deployed and maintained independently.

- **Use RESTful APIs.** Use RESTful APIs to communicate with the various services. This approach is widely used and standardizes communication with the different services.

- **Implement API gateways.** Use API gateways to manage communication with external services. API gateways are responsible for handling all incoming and outgoing requests, providing API validation, authentication, and authorization functionalities.

- **Use asynchronous communication.** Convert communication between services to asynchronous messaging to improve the reliability and scalability of the application.

An example of how I would set up the architecture is to build a front-end e-commerce website that integrates with multiple services such as payment services, inventory management services, and shipping services. The front-end can communicate with the services using RESTful APIs. Each service would have its own module, with the API gateway handling all incoming and outgoing requests. Asynchronous communication can be achieved using message queues. By implementing these best practices, the application would be scalable, reliable, and maintainable.
