Question: As a software engineer, you should provide efficient and clear code practices. Can you run us through your specific code practices and how you document your code?

Answer: 
As a frontend developer, I always follow following several code and document practices: 
 - **Keep the code simple and easy to read.** I keep the code as simple and easy to read as possible so that other developers could easily understand my code and make changes. I try to use meaningful variable and function names and avoid using abbreviations or unconventional naming.
 - **Keep the code consistent.** I will follow consistent code style and structure to make code easier to read and maintain. For example, I would use same indentation, code alignment and naming conventions.
 - **Follow best practices.** I will keep learning and using the best industry practices, such as using the latest technology and framework, and avoid using outdated or insecure methods in the code.
 - **Function and method documents.** I will comment at the beginning of functions and methods, including the description of their usage, inputs and outputs, etc.
 - **Code block comments.** I will comment at the beginning of code blocks to explain their usage and how to implement them.
 - **Project documents.** I will write project documents including project structure, dependencies, code specifications and other information. 

I believe through these practices, the code will have strong readability, maintainability and extensibility, and it will be easily to understand and modify.
